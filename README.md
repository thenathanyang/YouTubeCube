## Overview

We created a Youtube data visualizer that allows users to see various pieces of channel data in an interactive way. The data includes the name of a channel, its number of comments, its number of subscribers (subs), its number of video uploads (vids), and its number of views.

## Controls

* Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate the cube and the "r" key to reset the cube to its initial position.
* Enter a youtube channel in the box and press "View Channel" to see the data displayed on the cube.
